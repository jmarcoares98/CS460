 1. What does the following statement do?
arm-none-eabi-as -mcpu=arm926ej-s ts.s -o ts.o
It creates an object file 'ts.o' for ts.s which is our assembly code.

# 2. What does the following statement do?
arm-none-eabi-gcc -c -mcpu=arm926ej-s t.c -o t.o
This compiles t.c and it creates an object file 't.o'.

# 3. What does the following statement do?
arm-none-eabi-ld -T t.ld ts.o t.o -o t.elf
ld is a linker, so it links the object files we created from the 
two previous lines in order for it to be executable.

# 4. What does the following statement do?
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary t.elf t.bin
This is where it gets/copies all the contents from the elf file
and turn it into an executable file.
